Hi! Let me explain this step by step in a really simple way that you'll always remember!

**Think of the job like filling up a big swimming pool with water! 🏊‍♀️**

**Step 1: Understanding what "rate of work" means**
- If person A takes 40 days to fill the whole pool alone, that means every day A fills 1/40th of the pool
- It's like saying "A fills 1 bucket out of 40 buckets every day"

**Step 2: When they work together**
- Together, A and B can fill the whole pool in 8 days
- So together, they fill 1/8th of the pool every day
- It's like saying "together they fill 1 bucket out of 8 buckets every day"

**Step 3: Finding B's speed**
- A fills 1/40 of the pool per day
- A + B together fill 1/8 of the pool per day
- So B alone must fill: 1/8 - 1/40 of the pool per day

**Step 4: The math (don't worry, it's easy!)**
- To subtract 1/8 - 1/40, we need the same bottom number
- 1/8 = 5/40 (multiply top and bottom by 5)
- So: 5/40 - 1/40 = 4/40 = 1/10

**Step 5: The answer**
- B fills 1/10th of the pool every day
- So B needs 10 days to fill the whole pool!

**🎯 Memory trick for exams:**
Remember this formula: **1/Together = 1/A + 1/B**
- 1/8 = 1/40 + 1/B
- 1/B = 1/8 - 1/40 = 5/40 - 1/40 = 4/40 = 1/10
- So B = 10 days

**Quick check:** A does 1/40 per day, B does 1/10 per day. Together: 1/40 + 4/40 = 5/40 = 1/8 per day. Yes, they finish in 8 days! ✅

The answer is **B can do the job alone in 10 days**.
